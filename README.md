# COMP6714-Project-Part1

In this project: 
1) We compute TF-IDF score of a document w.r.t an input query Q and a Dictionary of Entities (DoE)
2) Split the query into all possible combinations of free keywords (ie. tokens and entities)
3) Finally, we use the TF-IDF index to compute scores for each query split, returning the query split with the max score.
